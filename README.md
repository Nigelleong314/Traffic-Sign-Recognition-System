# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-System
Baseline CNN model compared with traditional hand-crafted algorithm used as backbone of traffic sign predictions on top of pipeline of pre-processing, augmentation, and training/evaluation

Dataset: http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html#:~:text=Traffic%20Sign%20Recogntion%20Database&text=The%20TSRD%20includes%206164%20traffic,testing%20one%20contains%201994%20images.

dataset folder will contain Meta.csv, Test.csv and Train.csv
Meta.csv gives details on the 10 traffic signs 
Test.csv and Train.csv provides the features (bounding box coordinates) of the traffic signs and the image path.

The input folder contains:
meta folder (for original images of the 10 traffic signs)
test folder (contains all test images in .png format)
train folder (contains all train images in .png format)    

Names are labelled at each part of the coding respectively.
